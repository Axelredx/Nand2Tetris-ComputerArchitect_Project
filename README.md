# Architettura-Elaboratori
in this repository you can find beginner and advanced logic gates written for the NandToTetris project.
You can also find a VirtualMachine translater (last file) and a translater from HACK language to binary (WARNING: this program 
doesn't work on linux beacuse there is a different method of translating the string compared to windows)

some directory may contains files to test the programs.
