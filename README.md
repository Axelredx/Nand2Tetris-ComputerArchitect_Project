# Architettura-Elaboratori
in this repository you can find beginner and advanced logic gates written in HDL language for the Nand2Tetris project (directory 0 up to 4).
You can also find a VirtualMachine translater (last directory) and a translater from HACK language to binary (WARNING: this program doesn't work on linux beacuse there is a different method of translating the string compared to windows), some directory may contains files to test the programs.
